# Emotion Based Music Player
 In a world where we all are so much surrounded by machines, wouldn't it be great if we could have a software that could read our emotions and try to perform some  task based on that.
 
 In this project I have tried to implement something similar. "Emotion Based Music Player" is a web based application which uses deep learning to identify your emotions and based on your emotions play some of your favourite songs.
